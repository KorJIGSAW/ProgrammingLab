Man has existed for about a million years, 
and scientific tchnique for, at most, 200 years. 
Seeing what it has already accomplished, 
it would be very rash to place any limits upon 
what it may accomplish in the future. 
But scientific knowledge is an intoxication draught, 
and it may be one which the human race is unable to sustain. 
It may be that, like the men who built the Tower of Babel 
in the hope of reaching up to heaven, 
so the men who pursue the secrets of the atom will be punished 
for their impiety by providing by accident the means of exterminating 
the human species, and perhaps all life on this planet. 
From some points of view, such a consummation might not be 
wholly regrettable, but these points of viw can hardly be ours. 
Perhaps somewhere else, in some distant nebula, 
some unimportant star has an unimportant planet on
which there are rational beings. 
Perhaps in another million years their instruments will tell 
them of our fate, and lead them to agree on an agenda 
for a conference of foreign ministers. 
If so, man will not have lived in vain.
